Just some notes to track while getting started.

Steps...

Boards

1. Create channel
2. Create board from channel - This creates the workspace (that's not how this works, workspace is created when channel is created)
3. Create board - This creates 2 blocks and 1 card under the new workspace:
   a. board block
      I. Properties are created under this block and assigned to all cards
         i. Owner
         ii. URL of channel
         iii. Status if overdue or current
   b. view block
      I. Visible properties are defined under this block
   c. groups card

- A template is a block assigned to a single workspace.
- A workspace with no boards and no templates will return an empty array

4. Create groups - Groups are created inside of the group card inside a block
5. Create cards - Cards are created under a block, assigned to a group in properties

Playbooks

1. Get all active playbook runs by playbook ID

Todo:

1. Investigate card properties and add links, etc
   a. Channel URL - items.channel_id
   b. Playbook Owner - items.owner_user_id
   c. Status - overdue/current
2. Find out how playbooks calculate the overdue status
   You have to compute it. In the PlaybookRun model, you have the LastStatusUpdateAt field, which tells you when the last status update was posted. Then you have PreviousReminder, which is the time.Duration (nanoseconds) at which the next scheduled status update has to be posted
   These three lines cover what you need, I think https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/blob/master/webapp/src/components/rhs/rhs_post_update.tsx#L44-L46
