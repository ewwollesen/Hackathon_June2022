Just some notes to track while getting started.

Steps...

Boards

1. Create channel
2. Create board from channel - This creates the workspace
3. Create board - This creates 2 blocks and 1 card under the new workspace, a "board" block, "view" block, and a groups card.

- A template is a block assigned to a single workspace.
- A workspace with no boards and no templates will return an empty array

4. Create groups - Groups are created inside of the group card inside a block
5. Create cards - Cards are created under a block, assigned to a group in properties

Playbooks

1. Get all active playbook runs by playbook ID

Todo:

1. Investigate card properties and add links, etc
